# Polywrap Technical Council 


**Welcome to the Polywrap Technical Council!**

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the Polywrap Technical Council. 


## Overview
Technical Council (TC) is a core-development forum where new standards & features can be discussed and debated, with the goal of extracting as many key developer opinions as possible to ensure we’re making well researched and thoughtful decisions. 

Technical Council key focus areas:

- **Standards** - defined and agreed-upon technical norms, specifications and guidelines by which all Polywrap tooling should abide by. 
  - [Standards Documentation](https://github.com/polywrap/specification/tree/main/standard)
- **Features** - technical debates around specific implementation options and challenges, with a goal to provide a well-researched technical direction and further contribute to the definition of standards.
